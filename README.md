# Mortality analyses in an old-growth forest

This repository includes the data and R scripts to reproduce analyses and figures found in the article *Long-term impact of a major ice storm on tree mortality in an old-growth forest* by DeschÃªnes, Brice and Brisson published in Forest Ecology and Management.

All data used for the analyses can be found in the [data](https://github.com/mhBrice/mortality_Muir/tree/master/data) folder. Script #1 prepares and formats the data for the analyses performed in the script #2. The figures produced are in the [results](https://github.com/mhBrice/mortality_Muir/tree/master/results) folder.
